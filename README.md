## Bio :wave:
Hi, I'm Paras Gupta â€” a backend developer and AI enthusiast. I specialize in building scalable systems using Java (Spring Boot) and Python, and I enjoy turning raw ideas into functional, efficient products.

## About :sunglasses:
I work as an Associate Software Developer at Decimal Technologies, where I architect and deliver robust microservices using Spring Boot, Kafka, and Redis. On the AI side, I contribute to agentic models, data extraction pipelines, and computer vision modules using PyTorch, FastAPI, and Transformers.
My work blends backend engineering with AI R&D, always optimized for performance under resource constraints.

## Communities :dancers:
- Contributed at HostWeez (A Web Hosting Company)
- Contributed at RVPG Media (A News Publishing Organization)
